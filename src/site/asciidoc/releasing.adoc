= Releasing 

This should be of no interest to developers of Android applications. This is for 
those developers of the Android Maven Plugin who perform releases of the plugin.

== Introduction for Users

Releases are available through the Central Repository as built into Maven and as such no further configuration 
is required to use the plugin.

Development versions are occasionally deployed to the OSSRH snapshot repository. To use them you can proxy the 
snapshot repository in  your repository manager (good) or add it in your +settings.xml+ (ok) or +pom.xml+ 
(not so good but also possible).

----
<repositories>
  <repository>
    <id>ossrh</id>
    <url>https://oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/snapshots</url>
    <snapshots>
      <enabled>true</enabled>
      <updatePolicy>always</updatePolicy>
    </snapshots>
  </repository>
</repositories>
----

== General for Contributors

You have to be able to do full build of the plugin including site creation and integration tests: 

----
mvn install -P it
mvn site
----

Beyond that you need all the setup to deploy to the Central Repository. Follow the 
http://central.sonatype.org[setup instructions]. In addition you need to have permissions to deploy to the 
groupId. Contact the project owners, if required.

For site deployment you need to add your github credentials into settings.xml for the site deployment 
to github pages as part of the release build to work:

----
<server>
  <id>github</id>
  <username>yourname</username>
  <password>yourpassword</password>
  <configuration>
    <scmVersionType>branch</scmVersionType>
    <scmVersion>gh-pages</scmVersion>
  </configuration>
</server>
----

== Getting Ready

In order to release the plugin you need to have fully passing builds including integration tests 
and site creation.

== Deploy a SNAPSHOT version

If you want to make a binary version of Android NDK Maven Plugin available for someone to test, 
before making a proper release, deploy a SNAPSHOT version. This will make it available in the 
OSSRH snapshots repo (see above). It won't end up on the Central Repository.

To perform the SNAPSHOT release:

----
mvn clean deploy -P official-release
----

That should deploy the artifacts directly to the SNAPSHOT repo on http://oss.sonatype.org. 

== Perform a RELEASE

This is the real deal. A release will be synced to Maven Central after a few minutes, and then 
there is NO way to have it removed. Before you proceed ensure that 

- all tests pass
- site build passes
- changelog is up to date including the release date!

Once you are happy with the state of everything - Do it!

To perform the release:

----
cd android-ndk-maven-plugin
mvn release:prepare release:perform
----

If something goes wrong during the perform phase you can deploy from the target/checkout folder 
or checkout a branch of the tag.

----
mvn deploy site-deploy -P official-release
----

With the right setup this will

* create a tag and push it to github
* prepare and deploy everything for the plugin release (jar, sources, javadoc..) to OSSRH
* release the staging repository on OSSRH so the plugin is automatically synced to the Central Repository
* deploy the site to github pages

Announce on the Maven Android Developers list and the Maven developers and users mailing lists.

To obtain a correct permanent link to the announcement email, go to the Maven Android Developers group, 
open the announcement post and click the little chain/link icon to the right.

Once you are done with it all, celebrate as desired ;-) 

== After the release

* update changelog for next version 
* add release notes mailing list permanent link changelog
* change it-plugin.version parameter in IT test pom file to reference last release
