= IDE Support

The Android NDK Maven Plugin should work well with any IDE that has support for Android development and Maven projects 
coupled with support for native development. All this is managed by external projects. In the following are a few 
pointers.

== Eclipse

This works fine for full development. You will need to have ADT, http://eclipse.org/m2e/[M2Eclipse] 
and http://rgladwell.github.io/m2e-android/[m2e-android] installed as well as the 
https://eclipse.org/cdt[CDT tooling from Eclipse].

In the future this might work become even better with https://projects.eclipse.org/projects/tools.andmore[Andmore].
Eclipse developers have contributed features to this plugin.

== IntelliJ/Android Studio
