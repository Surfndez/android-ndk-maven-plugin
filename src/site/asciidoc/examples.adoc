= Android NDK Maven Plugin Example Projects

All the examples are located in +src/test/projects+ of the plugin code base. They are 
all stand-alone Maven projects that can be copied into a separate location and 
used as a basis or inspiration for your own projects and serve as useful
examples for all the different use cases of the Android Maven Plugin.

The are also built as part of the integration tests and the tests that run those
builds are all named '*SampleIT.java'. 

Typically you can do a full build of the application in the example with

----
mvn clean install
----

Multi-module examples will potentially require an attached device or emulator
and deploy the application and the integrations tests as part of the above
invocation.

In all cases you can deploy the application with

----
mvn android:deploy
----

and even start it with

----
mvn android:run
----

Check out the documentation on other link:plugin-info.html[goals of the plugin]
for other potential tasks to run and inspect the POM file to see used
the configuration and the IT test Java class for other example invocations.
